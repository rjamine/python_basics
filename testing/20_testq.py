# code question 20

#A list of float values measuring the percentage of CPU usage for servers has been collected. Servers with CPU usage greater than 90% should be flagged.
#
#Complete the Python function identify_high_cpu. The function should accept a list of floats representing the percentage of CPU usage for servers, determine which servers have higher than 90% CPU usage, and return the list of high-usage servers by index value.
#
#Only the identify_high_cpu function will be graded for this assessment. The function should work for any list of floats passed to identify_high_cpu beyond the examples provided.
#
#Example: If the stored CPU percentages are
#
#[85.0, 92.5, 88.0, 95.2]
#
#the expected return is
#
#[1, 3]
#
#Example: If the stored CPU percentages are
#
#[91.0, 88.8, 89.5]
#
#the expected return is
#
#[0]

#def identify_high_cpu(cpu_list):
#    # Write your code here.
#    pass

# You may alter the code below to test your solution or print help documentation.
# Only the identify_high_cpu function will be graded for this assessment.

# cpu_list = [85.0, 92.5, 88.0, 95.2]
