# code question 17
# A Python function same_subnetconverts IP addresses and subnet mask to binary strings in order to determine if two IPv4 addresses are in the same subnet, returning a string indicating whether both IP addresses are in the same subnet or not.
# 
# Complete the Python function same_subnet. The function should accept three strings representing two IP addresses and a subnet mask, determine if both IP addresses are in the same subnet, and return a predefined string statement indicating if both IP addresses are in the same subnet.
# 
# Only the same_subnet function will be graded for this assessment. The function should work for any IP addresses or subnet masks passed to same_subnet beyond the examples provided.
# 
# Example: If the two IP addresses and subnet mask are
# 
# '192.168.1.100', '192.168.1.200', '255.255.255.0'
# 
# the expected return is
# 
# 192.168.1.100 and 192.168.1.200 are in the same subnet
# 
# Example: If the two IP addresses and subnet mask are
# 
# '192.168.1.100', '192.168.2.200', '255.255.255.0'
# 
# the expected return is
# 
# 192.168.1.100 and 192.168.2.200 are not in the same subnet
#def same_subnet(ip1, ip2, subnet_mask):
#    # convert IP addresses to binary strings
#    ip1_bin = ''.join([format(int(x), '08b') for x in ip1.split('.')])
#    ip2_bin = ''.join([format(int(x), '08b') for x in ip2.split('.')])
#
#    # convert subnet mask to binary string
#    subnet_bin = ''.join([format(int(x), '08b') for x in subnet_mask.split('.')])
#
#    # get network address portion for both IP addresses
#    subnet_len = subnet_bin.count('1')
#    network1_bin = ip1_bin[:subnet_len]
#    network2_bin = ip2_bin[:subnet_len]
#
#    # Predefined statement indicating if IP addresses are in the same subnet
#    x = f"{ip1} and {ip2} are in the same subnet"
#    y = f"{ip1} and {ip2} are not in the same subnet"
#    
#    # Write a conditional expression to check if both IP addresses are in the same subnet
#    # and return the appropriate string output x or y.
#    # Write your code here.
