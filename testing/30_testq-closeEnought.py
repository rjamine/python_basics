# code question 30
#A bug has been submitted for a Python function named scan_ports. The function is supposed to use the socket library to scan the loopback address and check if ports 0-x are open/closed and return a list of tuples with the port status. Correct the logical errors in the code.
#
#Here is an example of the usage:
#
# print(scan_ports(5))
#
#Here is an example of the expected output:
#
#[(0, 'OPEN'), (1, 'OPEN'), (2, 'OPEN'), (3, 'OPEN'), (4, 'OPEN'), (5, 'OPEN')]
#
#    The Zybooks coding environment lacks outside connectivity, code to mock the return value for socket.connect_ex has been provided to allow normal use of the socket library for the socket.connect_ex function only. socket.connect_ex should always return 0 for this assessment.

    # Mock socket

        # Instantiate a socket object.
        socketObject = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
       # Set a timeout for the socket operations.
        socketObject.settimeout(5)
        # Create an empty list to store port status as a list tuples.
        open_ports = []  
        # Iterate over ports checking the connection and appending the port status to the list.
        for i in range(0, x+1):
            conn = socketObject.connect_ex((target_IP, i))
            if(conn == 0):
                  open_ports.append((i, 'OPEN'))
            else:
                  open_ports.append((i, 'CLOSED'))
        #socket.socket.close
        # Return the list of open ports as a list of tuples.
        return open_ports
# You may alter the code below to test your solution or print help documentation.
# Only the scan_ports function will be graded for this assessment.
