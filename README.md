# Python Basics 

This repository contains Python exercises and practice scripts created as part of my **Cloud and Network Engineering degree**. My intention is to strengthen my programming fundamentals while applying Python to IT, networking, and automation scenarios.

## Purpose 

Python is a ubiquitous tool for modern IT and networking tasks, kind of like what bash used to be, which is still used when needed, anyways for python I'm excited to: 

- Learn about the Python ecosystem and the lanugage itself 
- Automation of Network tests and device management
- Data parsing and reporting
- Scripting in general
- Random stuff I find interesting because why not
 
This repo serves both as a **learning portfolio** and a **versioned backup of exercises/fun memories** completed during my coursework and own leisure time.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic:
- **pythonTutorial/controlFlow/**
- **pythonTutorial/dataStructures/**
- **networkingTools/**
- **pythons_executionModel/executionPipeline_output.md** 
- **etc.,**

**pythonTutorial** is literally from https://docs.python.org/3.11/tutorial/ and for guidance each directory has either a -notstarted, -started, -reviewed, -done, at the end of each direcotry name, -reviewed means it was enough to just read through the text. 

A 'notes.md' file is included in some directories to track questions, reflections, and tasks related to python and its application to IT/networking labs.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the topic folder you want to explore.
2. Open/Execute the python files and review the exercises/code.
3. Check out 'notes.md' for reflections, questions, or tips on each topic.

## Goals
 
- Strengthen python and programming fundamentals relevant to computers, IT, and networking.
- Document learning progress and insights for future reference.
- Have fun.
