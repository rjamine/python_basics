# Python Basics 

This repository contains Python exercises and practice scripts created as part of my **Cloud and Network Engineering degree**. My intention is to strengthen my programming fundamentals while applying Python to IT, networking, and automation scenarios.

## Purpose 

Python is a ubiquitous tool for modern IT and networking tasks, kind of like what bash used to be and still is for some use cases and places, anyways for python I'm excited to do: 

- Automation of Network tests and device management
- Data parsing and reporting
- Scripting in general 
 
This repo serves both as a **learning portfolio** and a **versioned backup of exercises/fun memories** completed during my coursework and own leisure time.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic: 

- **loops/** 
- **operators/** 
-**functions/**
- **etc.,**
 
A 'notes.md' file is included to track questions, reflections, and tasks related to python and its application to IT/networking labs.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the topic folder you want to explore.
2. Open the python files ('.py') and review the exercises/code.
3. Execute scripts locally using python 3.x.
4. Review 'notes.md' for reflections, questions, or tips on each topic.

## Goals
 
- Strengthen python and programming fundamentals relevant to IT and networking.
- Document learning progress and insights for future reference.
- Have fun.
